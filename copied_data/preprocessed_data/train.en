Tom was completely soaked by the rain .
you will do no such thing .
so I enlist you to help me get the cooperation project started .
they know .
we didn &apos;t let the stores know we were coming .
it &apos;s able to feel when the cell is ready , when the chromosome is correctly positioned .

as soon as he arrived at the airport , he phoned his office .
I now finally understand what Tom was trying to tell me .
we will be studying at the University of San Francisco in September .
I want to know where you hid the key .
Tom slept much longer than he had intended .
hybrid means it &apos;s something that &apos;s half living and half machine .
that actually occurred this year . she took early retirement .
if Tom had more money , he &apos;d do that .
give me one reason why I shouldn &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t have the time .
I don &apos;t know either .
don &apos;t be so proud of your diploma
we have almost 14 million roots .
Tom suffered from a heart attack and almost died waiting for the ambulance .
and so I came up with a Life Box , because I needed a delivery system .

it &apos;s easy , isn &apos;t it ?
let me know your new address .
at that moment I became part of that biosphere .
we could not believe it .
and it &apos;s the whole field that we &apos;ve been trying to work on for the last 10 years at Intel .
this is going to be a glowing source first , which is like bioluminescent bacteria .
that &apos;s a lot of people .
if that happens , give me a call .
so you say to yourself , &quot; Well , that &apos;s worth something . &quot;
and one of the most tedious ones , I think , was saying that beauty was about symmetry .
this is an observatory in the Himalayas , in Ladakh in India .
we &apos;re warming the climate .
these are four 8.2 meter telescopes .

it &apos;s supposed to be attacking what &apos;s attacking the jellyfish .
I can &apos;t imagine how Tom has put up with Mary all these years .
she told me she knew you .
the bird was looking for worms .
it &apos;s part of life .
it is really -- I mean , I can &apos;t express to you how exquisite this object is .
CA : Incoming missiles from North Oxford at any moment .
I don &apos;t know if I can ever trust you again .
and you wouldn &apos;t believe it , but the one after that is going to be called The Overwhelmingly Large Telescope .
who was right ?
Tom looks a little annoyed .
one person wins .
they are actually red ; that &apos;s what gives blood its color .

it &apos;s the thing that distinguishes the puppet -- AK : Oops .
it was too late .
Tom is in a good mood .
now you probably know the answer to this already .
I don &apos;t get that at all .
that was true for Tom , too .

in Monaco , &quot; No , what are you talking about ?
and it &apos;s that Tuesday evening back in 1982 .
when the cell feels it &apos;s ready to go , it rips apart the chromosome .

you &apos;d better really love her ; people are unchangeable .
Tom went back home .

multi @-@ tasking can lead to being less productive .
Tom isn &apos;t ugly .
now , of course you couldn &apos;t do that today .
and most of those losses are because of things we know .
Applicants must be under thirty years old .
the eyebrows are doing this , the eyes are defocused , and the mouth is hanging open .
AB : 37 squared , OK .
why do you like us ?
Expansive listening , on the other hand , is listening &quot; with , &quot; not listening &quot; for . &quot;
he resolved to do better work in the future .
she is listening to him .
he likes chicken nuggets .
I &apos;ll support you as long as I live .
the door was locked on the inside .
he was one of the leaders of the revolution .
that &apos;s how people make GloFish .
do as I say .
this is one , Mimosa pudica .
suit yourself .
Tom has told us a lot about you .
I did another story on marine debris .
Mary , come quick ! a flying saucer has just landed in our garden .
so actually now on this website , we have 18,000 people .
so this is a single chromosome .
and that &apos;s Curtis Wong , WorldWide Telescope .
Massimo Tamburini .
these books are yours .
the only room available is a double .
it &apos;s a lot of stuff that goes behind these . these can talk to each other .
the problem is we can &apos;t show it to you any other way .
Europe has more culture !
it says kids over here , that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to talk about .

and in fact , it &apos;s upon us .
she wasn &apos;t on any medications which could produce hallucinations .
I don &apos;t want you to have anything to do with Tom .
Prevention is good , and I &apos;m doing the things that you can do to prevent Alzheimer &apos;s .
if we can get the 10 cents , all the rest of it flows .
I teach French .
and we had sleep apnea at night .
open the window .
this entrepreneurial energy is emerging from many quarters .
it &apos;s completely compatible with the God of the physicists .
and I announced I wanted to be a sculptor in Paris .
it &apos;s called the trillion @-@ dollar stimulus package .
she also likes chocolate .
could somebody put this guy up ?
and I don &apos;t have any smart technology for you to look at .
a tooth can be replaced with an implant .
and part of what Mission Blue is about is yelling , &quot; Stop ! &quot;
I hope you remember that .
however often I phone I can &apos;t get through .
does this dress look OK on me ?
&quot; why ? &quot; and they &apos;d say , &quot; Oh , it feels so natural , &quot; or , &quot; It &apos;s nice . &quot;
that &apos;s dangerous !
a lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed .
he &apos;s very sexy .
I spend most of my time working in the dark ; I &apos;m used to that .
Tom ordered a beer .
I store them as words , and later on retrieve them as numbers .
she had very mobile hallucinations as well .
I come from a conventional , middle @-@ class Nigerian family .
Liisa is regarded as the secret favorite .
I read this book when I was in college .
so here are some half @-@ finished horses ready to be worked in London .
they give rise to the trees , they create the debris fields that feed the mycelium .
a lot of my work is about trying to get away from this .
but in fact people say , &quot; I don &apos;t recognize the people . I can &apos;t form any associations . &quot;
I &apos;m walking across campus . cop comes and looks at me and says , &quot; You ! you &apos;re a student . &quot;
it &apos;s Mother &apos;s Day today .
I hope you learn .
Tom earns twice as much as me .
I wanted to buy the book .
wait &apos;ll you hear what happened today .
I think we &apos;ve got a lot of learning to do .
I know that Tom is illiterate .
in fact , if you &apos;re not in Nigeria , you &apos;re not in Africa .
you &apos;re thirty minutes early .
they &apos;d go , &quot; No , no . I don &apos;t need one of those .
in Africa , the Africans say , &quot; I am , because we are . &quot;
but if it had been following the odor plume , it would have come in from the other direction .
he eats nothing other than fruit .
so , what I &apos;d like to do now is try a little drawing .
Tom bought a rose and gave it to Mary .
not sure how this came to be , but it &apos;s not right .
Tom is interested in French literature .
is it beautiful ? is it exciting ?
well for the sake of time , I want to focus on just three strategies .
you know , try making some charts like this at home .
BJ : and the two manipulators are inside .
laughter is infectious .
are you coming to the store with me ?
that means the whole universe , known things and unknown things .
her friend is a singer .
I &apos;m not your enemy .
we &apos;ve known each other for more than thirty years .
the kitchen in that house is very nice .
do you even know who you &apos;re talking to ?
he doesn &apos;t eat anything other than fruit .
the blowfish is like the Incredible Hulk .
we decided to stay for a few more days .
Tom and Mary told John that they were ready to leave .
may not seem that large -- let &apos;s get closer .
that &apos;s the way we talk , right guys ?
go from 3,000 to 2,000 , from 1,500 to 1,000 .
he has enough willpower .
thank you very much .
Japanese people are fortunate to live in a land with natural hot springs .
and today , you would see this inside the mine , half a mile underground .
I &apos;ve never trusted Tom .
I wonder why they chose Tom .
we also have Dave Hackenberg , who is the poster child of CCD .
chases me into this room .
she rejected him .

and again , new forms of wealth emerged .

this was our laboratory before .
she is collecting on behalf of the blind .
Tom came to sit with me on the sofa .
watch what you &apos;re doing !
but also have the body language communicate something to the person who is looking at it .
and that is the spell that I want to break .
AK : you want to say something about the breathing ?
someone left you a message .
and I kind of broke the mold with Sherman .
so for example , Jackson came along and suggested that we use air pumps instead of water pumps .
and that &apos;s very important , the user interface .
and because your brain starter motor began there , now it &apos;s got to deal with it .
perfectly ordinary scientific paper .
Likewise .
&quot; how clever of sheep ! &quot; you might say .
this is a more competent version of it .
the United States are a republic .
what I want is some peace and quiet .
he stood by it in the face of repeated calls for clarification or withdrawal .
those horses are Tom &apos;s .
then I just pick things up .
I dipped my finger into the honey .
and guess what ? we won it hands down .
because I know we need to bring the wheel farther into the aerodynamics .
Tom told me what happened .
here are two of them .
I don &apos;t want to interrupt Tom while he &apos;s speaking .
she just wanted to get rid of me .
and this coordination may become even trickier with the introduction of cyber weapons .
it wasn &apos;t planned .
why didn &apos;t you come earlier ?
it &apos;s almost like you can see them learning over those last 10 problems .
Vampires because they suck the economic vitality out of their people .
do you have Russian newspapers ?
so that is not going to be the path to go .
the pyramid of ocean life ...
what if that wild bird flies by again ?
get out of my chair .
Tom didn &apos;t want to go there alone .
books alone , books written by lone individuals , are not going to change anything .
there &apos;s been a lot of folklore developed around the ocean , mostly negative .
I can &apos;t stop listening to this song .
we love this school .
except for that creepy guy in the background .

I don &apos;t feel comfortable here .
Tom taught Mary how to bake bread .
this was my backyard , very early on , when I bought my property .
do you remember the first time you were in a car and it did that ?
you can pray to him for help .
you ought to find nice shoes here .
all of which comes to what I wanted to say .
Tom is just sitting on the porch , doing nothing .
here &apos;s a scene that shows you the balloon and the payload end @-@ to @-@ end .
you are the reason I &apos;m here .
and seeing with the brain is often called imagination .
I will visit Kyoto .
they &apos;re not radically different from routers inside the middle of the network .

don &apos;t you want to know what happened ?
&quot; yeah , go to your room . &quot;

it is an essential pillar to this country &apos;s recovery .
strange .
we have no choice but to compromise .
we can &apos;t even be certain that it was Tom &apos;s voice we heard .
the coffee &apos;s on me .
I &apos;ve made things worse .
thanks to you .
I &apos;ve got something I want to show you .
I know that scares a lot of you , but that was my purpose entirely .
I sat in the waiting room for what seemed like hours .
I started this thread .
is there anything in that rumour ?
the green movement significantly inspired the world .
I want to send them a letter .
it &apos;s a cooler @-@ looking chicken .

Tom stepped forward to kiss Mary , but she stepped back .
the lesson we learn from this is you don &apos;t have to have a mind to be a beneficiary .
and somebody brought a boyfriend , somebody a father .
many young people are out of work in that country .
and these are not really a people oppressed by poverty .
so , this would be the Twitter search screen .

I don &apos;t know if today is Tuesday or Wednesday .
he has good reason to get very angry .

I didn &apos;t get a chance to visit the art museum .
he &apos;s a British citizen , but he lives in India .
and this is all done , by the way , by the International Astronomical Union .

but that is another story .
are you using the phone ? are you socializing less than you used to ?

when actors decide to become musicians , they usually become pigeonholed quickly .
we forgot about the entire chain around us .

Yes , I &apos;m Tom &apos;s sister , but I &apos;m not like him !

so I said , &quot; What sort of things ? &quot;
Mary has long legs .
Tom now wears a wig .
now think about religions , think about organized religions .

Tom thought he had all the time in the world .
this is the house where I lived when I was a child .
I &apos;m glad you were there .
Tom is quite funny .
don &apos;t make me say it .
you have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars .
they are so different .
what would you have done in his place ?
it &apos;s clear to me . &quot;
what is the evidence upon which this is based ?
listen to Tom .
it looks as though he &apos;s wishing that he didn &apos;t win .

sometimes I wish I had a twin brother . that &apos;d be fun .
I was like , &quot; Actually it was your idea . you said it in a Fortune Magazine article .

look at this magnificent beast and ask the question -- who designed it ?
Tom is an expert on neural networks .
I know what you &apos;re doing .
it wasn &apos;t in Paris that we met .

Tom is a bad liar .
and this is the dilemma , this is the paradox , of beauty .
I fell asleep while I was watching TV .
whose son are you ?
I certainly had no idea Tom was planning to move to Boston .
and of course they don &apos;t .
I suggest the house .
it &apos;s a wildcard for disarming any reasonable criticism .

she had no control over them .
now I &apos;m using microseconds wrongly here , so please ignore me .
I don &apos;t like flying .

Mary said that she was desperate .
I like Tatoeba &apos;s random sentence . it &apos;s fun because it &apos;s random !
how did Tom get his hands on so much money ?
now it &apos;s gone .
he is a very lazy boy .
will we be quick enough to react before millions die ?
and reading that book made me reexamine that theory because I need to explain what I mean by that .
I cannot thank him enough .
the reason why we have two ears and only one mouth is so that we may listen more and talk less .

I could keep it a secret .
you tried to stop Tom from doing that , didn &apos;t you ?
she &apos;s an airhead .
so they need a vector -- and this vector , it &apos;s normally an animal .
the reality , now here is something important .
the crime was premeditated .
Tom was charged with domestic violence after he tossed a biscuit at Mary .
so this makes us very happy , because now we also have some evidence that this is working .
I have lost my pen .
the next island was not too hard to find , and that was Hawaii .
so , we have this ability as well .
I do not have a lot of money .

it is getting warmer day by day .
I can meet you at the bus station .

Tom didn &apos;t sound worried .
how disgusting !
what &apos;s that you &apos;re working on ?

so they go around in this loop , which is why you see them up there .
my colleagues warmly welcomed me .
I &apos;m sorry , but I didn &apos;t know it was a secret .
the secular world is full of holes .

I &apos;ll show you the car I &apos;ve just bought .
you may give the book to whoever wants it .

that characterization , in my view , is even more charitable .
no one can do it for you . you have to do it for yourself .
I can beat Tom .
Tom slept on the floor that night .

that &apos;s the oldest trick in the book . I can &apos;t believe you fell for it .
and there they had a detention camp where alleged Vietnamese would be tested , language tested .
here &apos;s the balloon being filled up with helium , and you can see it &apos;s a gorgeous sight .
OK , I &apos;ll order it .
we call it the Water Canary .
should I give Tom this ?
did Tom say where Mary might be ?
&quot; don &apos;t ever argue with the Devil .
as long as it &apos;s good for you and good for the environment , it doesn &apos;t matter .
I mean it really is .

at that time , it was the head of Caritas Germany .
he lost everything he owned .
I don &apos;t know what they &apos;re going to do with all that stuff .
it &apos;s their kind of ur @-@ story onstage , that desperation to live .
they have computing power , they have electrical signals .
and so , there are many of those things that start to happen .
with my dad , that turned out to be letting him fill out forms .
your idea sounds like a good one .
show me a cheaper one , please .
I &apos;ll tell you what it is .
these women and those young men united Iranians across the world , inside and outside .
today &apos;s weather forecast proved right .
BG : is this ready for prime time ?
what &apos;s your sixth sense ?
everyone is equal before the law .
Tom has lots of things to tell Mary .
Tom did the best he could , but he wasn &apos;t able to get a higher grade than Mary .
why isn &apos;t that good ?
now , all of these big things for love -- experiments -- aren &apos;t going to take off .
we need an anti @-@ Templeton to step forward .
in Africa , the Africans say , &quot; I am , because we are . &quot;
those words are by Rick Warren .
Tom is plowing his field .
no human heart is denied of that empathy .
I &apos;m at Carnegie Mellon ; we &apos;ve got a great Robotics Institute there .
I actually enjoyed that .
my big sister showers every day .
and it made it possible , in fact , for us to take on this plan .
that was -- here we have 65 @-@ million @-@ year @-@ old heme .
and that &apos;s what I did . twenty @-@ seven years ago I started working on this .
Tom says hello .
how do we get a personal baseline about what &apos;s going to work for you ?
please look at me .
hello ? and I can ... hello ... okay .
this is the Africa that is changing , that Chris alluded to .
we &apos;re not quite a YouTube .
we go back down . it &apos;s going to go up and down .
you &apos;re having to imagine it .
they have assigned me a small room .
95,218,564 ?
Tom needs you here .

the dogs barked all night .
are you certain nobody followed you ?
how do I explain it ?
it &apos;s like the blind leading the clueless .

no one can do it for you . you have to do it for yourself .
and the watchmaker turned around and said , &quot; God can see it . &quot;
it &apos;s a miracle that he wasn &apos;t killed in the accident .
now this , for me , is a common situation .
you sir , that &apos;s three , And anybody on this side here ?
it &apos;s phenomenal .
another problem : unhealthy food systems and unemployment .
you need to get your eyes checked .
what were you doing out here ?
the money will carry us for about a month .
I work in Morocco , in Turkey , in Mexico .
the export of arms was not allowed .
they don &apos;t own them .
it will cost around fifteen dollars .
Archaeopteryx , which is a bird , a primitive bird , still has that very primitive hand .
where &apos;s the dining room ?
so I &apos;m hoping you can see a little theme here .
Tom arrived early .
we don &apos;t know yet if he really broke his leg . they &apos;ll do an X @-@ ray of it .
open the door !
he made up the story .
think of what this got them .
this is where Tom used to sit .
I really like the art of Mantegna .
do you think that we were lovers in a past life ?
they &apos;re our cottage industries . they are vulnerable , single people .
all Tom needs is a little love and affection .
that was very funny .
Australia is about twenty times as large as Japan .
and what you &apos;re typing are recordings of your eyes as you &apos;re looking at other peoples &apos; eyes .
now religions have a much saner attitude to art .
9,758 , this will take me a little bit of time , so bear with me .
do I need to set the table ?
I &apos;m sorry , but it &apos;s really not possible .
I &apos;m feeling it here . I feel it here .
and so I killed a character that &apos;s been in the newspaper for 15 years .
they were left to fend for themselves .
how many friends do you have on Facebook ?
and even then , what kind of socialism did they practice ?
does anyone still do that ?
Tom is likely to tell you some things that aren &apos;t true .
Mary lost her favorite pen .
and they populate much larger areas .
taking moderate exercise will do you good .
his debt amounted to a considerable sum .
it &apos;s not like we &apos;re starting with something that &apos;s been okay .
he said it as a joke .
they were not starving .
don &apos;t let us down .
it was so cold that I couldn &apos;t sleep .
it was really quite astonishing .
it sounds strange .
he &apos;s a great white shark .
he slowly finished the race .
he made 15,000 dollars cash and bought the house that I grew up in .
but only at the very top of this pyramid do these things become completely human .
I &apos;m still undecided .
carl Safina : the oil spill &apos;s unseen culprits , victims
you wouldn &apos;t lie .
Tom seems to be depressed .
anthropology , humanity , love , psychology , social media , society , technology
I lost my face .
where can I find the visitor center ?
Tom is the same age as Mary .
that &apos;s pretty neat .
almost three thousand people died .
whose clever move was it ?
so the idea of electronic books is starting to come about .
I thought you loved me .
Tom is never going to let you go to Boston with Mary .
try this on .
and I &apos;m asking , &quot; What am I doing here ? why am I here ? &quot;
I &apos;m looking for a book about medieval Spain .
she looked me in the eye .
Tom closed his eyes and began to count sheep .

the first offshore wells were called whales .
you have to begin as soon as possible .
if you fail the IQ test they ask you to leave the country .
you can &apos;t say that .
that implies the trusted person won &apos;t violate the trust .
many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it .
I can swim as well as you .
and it &apos;s one that echoes remarks that you &apos;ve heard already today .
what was that story ? the death of Anna Nicole Smith .
I am not guilty !
that &apos;s where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one .
and they didn &apos;t just all chase Jeeps around .
I &apos;ve always liked to draw , so I &apos;m doing it more even though I &apos;m really very bad at it .
it produces these strings of light , presumably as some form of defense .
Tom is a normal child .
prime numbers , Gauss , one of my favorites .
they are constantly upgrading , and in a few cases , the government helps .
the fact is that he did not notice the difference .
they want to learn English .
Frank Wilson had written a book called &quot; The Hand . &quot;
where in Austria did you grow up ?
Tom was sitting in the dark , smoking a cigarette .
we have to operate urgently .
they &apos;re the grand molecular disassemblers of nature -- the soil magicians .
but for us it meant freedom .
and kids starting to make their own books , and a happy kid with the first book that he &apos;s ever owned .
I want to start now .
the rumor must be true .
it &apos;s unacceptable .
and they don &apos;t really change much .
I visited Tom yesterday .
he gets finned , and then he gets thrown overboard .
you really sleep a lot !
but , like all of us , he had some problems .
I &apos;m blind in one eye , and not terribly good in the other .
as soon as he went out , it began to rain .
Narrator : as the hunters display their kills , something surprising happens .
I like that piece of furniture very much .
then we shook hands and said good @-@ bye .
I was involved in a traffic accident .
I didn &apos;t want to go with this ruthless predator image .
you can &apos;t have both .
you and Tom have a lot in common .
have you ever danced in a party ?
and I also whistled at a Christmas Eve party with my family @-@ in @-@ law .
his failure has nothing to do with me .
the water in this village is contaminated by arsenic .
and critically , what happens in central Africa doesn &apos;t stay in Central Africa .
a galaxy . hey , there &apos;s another galaxy .
you &apos;re incompetent .
animals too .
you must follow the regulations .
you need to ask Tom what he &apos;ll do .
it &apos;ll take two hours to get there by bus .
Tom prefers dogs to cats .
the water is turned into goo .
this is for internal use .
the weight is really difficult when it &apos;s up above your head .
we know how Tom is .
she learned English with great eagerness .
we emptied the ocean of the whales at that time .
make sure Tom doesn &apos;t see you .
isn &apos;t Tom afraid ?
and so we &apos;re starting up a program to do out @-@ of @-@ print works , but loaning them .
Al Gore : I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on .
my mother sent yams and rice , and our old clothes , to his family .
and I have to make it clear , it &apos;s not just me anymore .
the lights are out .
apart from a few minor mistakes , your composition was excellent .
I think that vote is occurring right now .
could you do me a small favor ?
I never wanted you to go .
I know I &apos;ve been acting strangely .
you said give it to Tom .
in space , no one can hear you scream .
I &apos;ve taken them camping in the kelp forests of California .
but then I started getting letters from teachers .
I don &apos;t know what this kind of stuff will do in their gills .
I don &apos;t have to tell you this .
Al Gore on averting climate crisis
she &apos;s my older sister .
now it &apos;s your turn .
something has to be done .
you drive . you take your depleted battery out .
and here &apos;s one that does concern me .
here &apos;s what some of this data might look like .
I went to the station .
he never saw Mary again .
that number is rising .

this is the Best Buy in New York City .
water is as precious as air .
it makes me nervous .
all is over .
there are fifty stars on the American flag .
back to the cow .
and the thing I want you to look at here is the telescope on the right @-@ hand side .
well , we &apos;re best known as the World Wide Web .
how could I help you ?

what scared you ?
it &apos;s interesting to learn a foreign language .
and in this project we &apos;ve developed a form of intelligent real @-@ time subtitles .
you can &apos;t own your children .
if it gets far away , it &apos;s a little too quiet .
I go to a place where a dowel splits off .
the work is too hard for me .
and you realize where you are ; you &apos;re in the Louvre .
I want to eat kimbap .
Tom admitted that he was scared .
it wasn &apos;t just to kind of make it cute , because somebody -- you know , good design is very important .
her dream is to become a nurse .
now , so I know the frequency .
Tom passed away three days ago .
this is DNA in its classic double helix form .
I &apos;m looking for a third way : I &apos;m preparing to get Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
I quit smoking two years ago .
I forgot to attach a stamp to the envelope .
Tom was insane .
and then a few other things started to dawn on me .
you fake it and make it . this is the mantra of the United States of America .
once again , that &apos;s Sierra Leone .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / yochai _ benkler _ on _ the _ new _ open _ source _ economics.html
it was astonishing . they were also producing mangroves in a plantation .
already eaten ?
Mary said she thought Tom wasn &apos;t finished doing that yet .
but now it actually might be more technically accurate because it might bang .
and now you are helping me to regain some confidence in the future . &quot;
and that was really critical . the mesh network , it &apos;ll become commonplace .
AB : 59 squared , OK , and finally ?
now when we &apos;re looking at solving big problems , we need to start thinking in two numbers .
so I invite you to explore the opportunities .
I should have read the insurance policy more carefully .
Tom said that Mary was willing to help us do that .
don &apos;t expect too much of me .
a lot more to be said about that .
I know what &apos;s wrong with him .
women typically listen expansively .
this cop comes after me with a rifle .
you &apos;re my best customer .
it &apos;s like a coin flip ; it doesn &apos;t count really .
audience : 23rd .

when they were sick , we would collect specimens from them .
they are constantly upgrading , and in a few cases , the government helps .
this is a picture of what Pursat looks like .
I wonder if I can add a sentence .
well , there &apos;s a sense which I agree with him , except I think it has an evolutionary explanation .
what happened between you and Tom ?
this is not -- no , no , no , this is not claps .
and if each one of you sends it to 300 or 400 people , that would be fantastic .
please bring your own cutlery .
he was killed in a car accident .
I just can &apos;t overlook his rude behavior .
the track that I will whistle is called &quot; Fête de la Belle . &quot;
the accent is on the &quot; I. &quot;
she ought to have arrived by now .
I have to finish the work by four o &apos;clock .
how do they look ?
it &apos;s a lot of stuff that goes behind these . these can talk to each other .
I &apos;m a US citizen .
I see this horse with a harness , dragging the snow away .
he satisfied his thirst with a large glass of beer .
so I could have anything I wanted other than bbn.com and symbolics.com .
Tom couldn &apos;t believe that Mary had tricked him .
so yeah , we &apos;re transforming things into something that you have absolutely no reference for .
and all the symptoms stayed the same or even got worse .
so here &apos;s a comparison of several of these new vaccine technologies .
now , that &apos;s a lot , a lot of bees , and that &apos;s really important .
some boys play tennis and others play soccer .
Tom complains that his new phone is too big and that it won &apos;t fit in his pants .
and then I was overwhelmed with shame .
the bulkheads have now turned into hoops of cane , but it &apos;s ultimately the same structure .
the key is on the table .
it &apos;s now repetition of short , hot @-@ button , 30 @-@ second , 28 @-@ second television ads .
fun became earnest . earnest is now four years old .
everyone has a bedroom .
so the culture , the northern aboriginal culture , traditionally has been highly seasonal .
you see the string tendon from the hyena , the hyena &apos;s front leg , automatically pulls the hoop up .
woman : 1369 . AB : 1369 .
would you mind taking the brain out , and I just want you to feel something .
now , obviously it makes common sense that if you want to help the people , you go where the people are .
audience : 321 .
Tom steered the car with his knees .
the sisters often quarrel over nothing .
after several delays , the plane finally left .
he made me a new suit .
or if you light it from above , it becomes more solid .
nobody knows you &apos;re here .
okay . Ah , there is lots of nice bright video .
AK : haa haa haaa .
what we started to do was to realize that we had to take charge and reform ourselves .
the principal challenge for both of these viruses is that they &apos;re always changing .
now here we &apos;ve seen many wonderful maps of the world in the last day or so .
instead of 600 , immediately I &apos;m saving 200 grand .
I &apos;m not going to dive into them either , but photosynths are integrated into the map .
that &apos;s not wealth creation . it &apos;s wealth redistribution .
swami Dayananda Saraswati : the profound journey of compassion
and so we had , as was the norm , live @-@ in domestic help , who would often come from nearby rural villages .
what do you want anyway ?
we have another well @-@ known case -- Gustavo Dudamel .
that evening I left my tip under a coffee cup , which I left upside down on the table .
he keeps harping on about declining standards in education .
it had by no means got the green light yet .
there are other animals that pollinate , like bats , and bats are in trouble too .
and they said , &quot; Oh , this is kind of radical . we have to think about it . &quot;
the players slowly explore the environment , and begin again to test things out .
and by the way , there &apos;s no pleasure in that face .
then there is a rustle in the brush .
was the teacher young ?
and so what we &apos;re looking for is that gene .
all of these stories make me who I am .
now , I just do not believe that .
my office folds away , easily hidden .
Tom is now truly on his own .
Surfers , for example , know this incredibly .
I &apos;m hoping Tom learns from his mistakes .
how is the weather in Boston ?
this is going to be problematic .
Tom likes making paper aeroplanes .
this is the story of a rake in my backyard .
now , to bring that home , I thought I &apos;d invent a little game .
if I squeeze the tip , they go from tip to base .
Tom and Mary told John they wanted Alice to teach them how to do that .
I &apos;m not going to do that again .

it &apos;s not an insult . it &apos;s an observation .
he &apos;s a landlubber .
now , I loved those American and British books I read .
I have no idea what will happen next with Twitter .
all you have to do is write a few sentences about what you did yesterday .
Tom knows it &apos;s true .
I go running across campus quick as I can . I duck into Hayes Hall .
I &apos;d like to end with a little metaphor here .
and we &apos;ll come back to chromosomes in a minute .
Tom was as naked as a jaybird .
Tom and Mary loved each other .
Tom didn &apos;t like being poor .
they show us filter paper they &apos;ve used to collect the animals &apos; blood .
so you &apos;re getting feedback on those teacher views to see what they think they mean ?
five percent of our greenhouse gases are produced by mowing our lawns .
and this is the scene that greets you in McMurdo .
Tom became a whistleblower .
I &apos;ve got one more problem , then I &apos;m through .
but the truth of the matter is that this is going on .
I never go anywhere .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me anything about you .
no one agreed with me .
when I arrived I didn &apos;t speak a word of French , and I still seemed to understand what it was he was saying .
she &apos;s a lot older than he is .
I did something that nobody else had done .
how did you make it ?
so religions are the foremost example of an institution that is fighting for the things of the mind .
and he said one of them is called Maluma .
if you can &apos;t come , please let me know ahead of time .
I scored only 33 points on the test .
he just wants to wish her a good day , because that &apos;s the start of her day .
Tom and Mary told John that they were annoyed .
he eats non @-@ stop .

and they &apos;re happy over and over again .
I just want you back .

these women and those young men united Iranians across the world , inside and outside .
and I think that there is an easy cure for NDD .
they continued the experiment day and night .
the sky was blue .
Tom has been to Boston a number of times .
and that was a Humboldt squid , a juvenile Humboldt squid , about three feet long .
do you get along well with your new classmates ?
the reality is that covering Britney is cheaper .
okay , I &apos;m not the only one whistling here .
hug me .
but if we &apos;re serious people , we don &apos;t admit to that .
who &apos;s she ?
and secondly , it &apos;s trying to remind you of what there is to fear and to hate .
so , encouraged by this , naturally we went to flu viruses .
here &apos;s a big crowd .
Tom asked Mary for her telephone number .
Tom looks irritated .
I cannot afford to buy a new bicycle .
you can &apos;t skip cutscenes in this game .

it takes two to tango .
it &apos;s snowing there .
that was interesting .
you were always too busy to talk to me .
Tom felt sad .
and probably a whole bunch of trees as well .
he ripped his shirt open .
so it &apos;s a continued fight .
when images are formed , a higher part of the visual cortex is involved in the temporal lobe .
I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon .
after eating cheap sushi , all Tom could think about was brain worms .

what if that wild bird flies by again ?
we then decided to scale it up .
and I hope that you experience it and I hope you tell me about it one day .
Sherman &apos;s up in shark heaven .
I store them as words , and later on retrieve them as numbers .

Kendo is a Japanese martial arts which uses bamboo swords and protective armour .
not me , that was for sure .
and I &apos;ve already hinted what that something is .
but also have the body language communicate something to the person who is looking at it .
I created a little oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
the appearance of them would have been different -- which it is in all social animals .
but I really did struggle for financial support .
Polyglots are much sexier .
so how would you run a whole country without oil ?
I can &apos;t see well .
Tom knows what happened .
a violinist I know claims that he owns a Stradivarius .
is he drinking coffee ?
you should go home .
the first is mass collaboration , represented here by Wikipedia .
he has money .
it wasn &apos;t just to kind of make it cute , because somebody -- you know , good design is very important .
and while I &apos;m okay now , I wouldn &apos;t wish this gift for you .
well , I &apos;ve more or less said what I wanted .
it is only if one is visually impaired or blind that the process is interrupted .
now , we &apos;re not saying don &apos;t help Africa .
the Japanese are generally considered to be very industrious .
and so that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking into .
we heard about the atmosphere as a thin layer of varnish .
Mary told me she wasn &apos;t sleepy yet .

all right . I &apos;m hitting it . I &apos;m punching play .
you have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do .
this is something to consider .
Tom didn &apos;t want to say anything .
I love eating melons .
be careful ! the knife is very sharp .

you know , I was wondering about Freudian determinants .
he even became uncharacteristically tetchy with Edward Aveling .
do you understand that ?
Tom is more experienced than me .
the windows were open .
Tom &apos;s new camera can take images with much higher pixel counts than his old one could .
I &apos;m retired , too .
some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms .
he attributed his success to good luck .
and she has a sense of humor .
Mary earns her living as a guitarist .
and we end up in Hong Ngu on the Vietnamese side .
did they say what happened ?
are they friends ?
he added that he didn &apos;t believe it .
I can tell you for a fact , that the next one that they &apos;re planning is called The Extremely Large Telescope .

Tom said Mary may do that .

Tom &apos;s alcoholic father often beat him up .

this app will let you sync your photos and music between all your devices .
they don &apos;t usually like to go into water that is very cloudy anyway .
that &apos;s an odd request .

in its essence , the orchestra and the choir are much more than artistic structures .
she goes to school .
we can do it that way .
I &apos;ve started teaching my kids to surf .
so where does this lead ?
it &apos;s exciting .
the rain hasn &apos;t stopped yet , has it ?
all this leads to the development of self @-@ esteem and confidence .
I &apos;ll gladly help you .
Tom was totally snockered before the party even began .
in other words at some point when we &apos;ve recovered we go up to the peak .
and this is a really emancipatory and political contribution to peace and reconciliation .
now , I talked to Paul afterwards .
we can invite partners who can support us , but we have to start .
no human power can manage that .

they get scared to walk around . they get scared to move .
I thank you for your attention .
but not just that , they actually banned money .
Mary has not arrived yet .
but I did in fact get married in it .
I asked for a seat in the no @-@ smoking section .
and that &apos;s important for many fronts , and one of them is because of that culture that &apos;s in agriculture .
they built up twenty @-@ five stories on one side and thirty @-@ five stories on the other .
we must act quickly .
that means their immune systems are compromised .
I &apos;ll get Tom to listen .
you shouldn &apos;t do his work .
we think that &apos;s a good thing .
you could never do that .
it is still too early to draw conclusions .
think of it as a project that spans over about 10 years .
the answer misses the point .
I &apos;m surrounded by linguaphiles !
I &apos;ve eaten a great deal of food this week .

we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re saying .
Tom returned from the kitchen with two mugs of coffee and sat down next to Mary .
when they make a profit it is theirs to keep , not for the chief to sequester it from them .
and I was struck by the juxtaposition of these two enormous disciplines that humanity has .
it &apos;s got a chin barbel .
Tom doesn &apos;t drink or smoke .
I have some problems with the book .
I asked Tom if he was nervous .
and in particular , what we &apos;ve seen is task organization .
many things have been said about this .
is there electricity in your house ?

I was bored .
and there are brittle stars that produce bands of light that dance along their arms .
did you enjoy the game ?
as you can see , these are all maps .
we &apos;re going to be doing genuine physics . &quot;
the village was silent .
I thought Tom and Mary would figure it out for themselves .

take a look , if you haven &apos;t , at DonorsChoose .
audience : six . AB : six .
but what we &apos;re seeing now is the emergence of this fourth system of social sharing and exchange .
we decided to come into the U.S .
I never told anybody . this is the first thing . this could be history .
would you mind if I ask you a personal question ?
we need more talented people .

the trouble with widespread headphone use is it brings three really big health issues .
I &apos;m noticing that it &apos;s happening all over the country , and the good news is that it &apos;s growing .
a snowflake landed on the tip of Mary &apos;s nose .
you fake it and make it .
it wasn &apos;t the cleverness of the sheep at all .
so what do you think happens if you squeeze it in the middle ?
I &apos;d like to kick off by looking at education .
did you bring the book ?
that was whistling .
but then , how to act compassionately if you don &apos;t have compassion ?
nobody really knows what the Internet is right now because it &apos;s different than it was an hour ago .
I know you can &apos;t speak French .
it &apos;s about 80 minutes long .
we &apos;ve taken them out of their natural pyramid in order to solve this problem .
they seem to come from the outside , and to mimic perception .
war and malnutrition kills people together with hope .
one problem : waste handling and unemployment .
Tom tried to walk on water , but he sank to the bottom .
where are you feeling this ?
why don &apos;t we take a taxi ?
women typically listen expansively .
a loud knocking at the door woke him up .
a man who turns towards me and smiles .
when will Latin finally be buried as a dead tongue ?
there &apos;s an apple in this boy &apos;s pocket .
as is often the case , he eats while reading a newspaper .
Ubald laughs at me when I show this photo because of course you can &apos;t see his face .
didn &apos;t have to worry about what people thought about me .
&quot; hello ? Uh , hey . &quot;
Tom is full of life .
I don &apos;t want to see you again .
is it that hard ?
and that was done also without permission , although no one seemed to care .
it was stupid of you to have turned down the offer .
that is the thing that concerns you .
I know what &apos;s wrong with her .
well actually , I &apos;ve &#91; been &#93; whistling since the age of four , about four .

you can forget about that .
so , why don &apos;t we hear more about the world ?
how did you become a police officer ?
we &apos;re talking to something .
the animals are simply gone .
it &apos;s unbelievable .
that &apos;s the Devil speaking . &quot;
and both require silence of some sort .
Patrice and Patee have been out for hours but found nothing .
those of you who are physicists , I hear you rolling your eyes , but bear with me .
I will not sell my soul .

she &apos;s my classmate .

his behavior alienated his friends .
here &apos;s one , not as beautiful as the others .
are you sure that this isn &apos;t true ?
and I &apos;d really like to get a response if Rick is able to do it .
how bad was Tom hurt ?
she looked at me like I was crazy .
it will be quitting time before you get that done .
so , doctors prescribe medication .
and another possibility is a technological possibility .
I don &apos;t want to see you guys yet .
in the old days , things were a lot simpler .
Mary told Tom that she thought John was honest .
seriously , but dangerously fun .
come on , it &apos;ll be fun .
Bob helped me .
whose turn is it to deal the cards ?
and that process takes about two hours .
this comes across also in the way in which religions set up rituals around important feelings .
where is the Palace of Fine Arts ?
now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging -- that it chirps up at the end .
and they begin an incredible ballet .
Tom is disloyal .
you whistle the same tone as me .
on the whole , the result was unsatisfactory .
rent is expensive here .
I didn &apos;t promise anything like that .
just give some indication if it &apos;s right .
the self : you are self @-@ aware .
don &apos;t push me !
American films are popular around the world .
we &apos;re selling a billion cell phones worldwide this year .
what the world needs now are these new vaccines , and we can make it happen .
which is not to be confused with the five sacred salads .
there &apos;s definitely a method to my madness -- definitely , definitely . sorry .
but we sent -- thought , OK , if we &apos;re going to need to do this , let &apos;s do it in @-@ library .
so my core team and I are able to concentrate on the improvements that really benefit everyone .
it &apos;s to culture that we should look for guidance , for consolation , for morality .

here &apos;s my proposal .
we enjoyed seeing the city , but we got a little tired .
I have never been so humiliated in my entire life .
and the red region is a slice into a red blood cell .
let &apos;s take it on a maiden voyage .

or take this swordfish .
I cannot pass the matter by without making a protest .
they never showed up .
but nonetheless , it &apos;s an extraordinary piece of engineering .
I bet the teacher &apos;s going to get mad !
that &apos;s not the only reason .
a few years ago , I visited Mexico from the U.S .
Darwin said , &quot; I have never been an atheist in the same sense of denying the existence of a God .
now , obviously I said this in a fit of mild irritation .

and I &apos;ve already hinted what that something is .

I &apos;m getting sick and tired of Ms Maruta and her noisy friends .
it was 1971 , the Vietnam War was going on , and I &apos;m like , &quot; Oh my God ! &quot;

and what I &apos;m just going to do is -- I &apos;m going to hide that .

and I tried to build a particle accelerator .
how about you come with me ?
Tom lives in a row house .
I &apos;ll be back in a while .
so it was pretty interesting stuff .
he saw that he was wrong .
and I present to you a concept that these are extended neurological membranes .

how do we get a personal baseline about what &apos;s going to work for you ?
cancer , medicine , personal growth , storytelling
and here &apos;s one that does concern me .
you &apos;re completely right !
we had a very vigorous debate .
is she Japanese ?
she gave me her phone number .
where &apos;s my family ?
why did we not find some other solution to this ?
something that would be important , but also something that would take advantage of all of these privileges that one had . &quot;
the lady over there is actually crying , by the way .
we need more eyes on the process .
be content with your lot ; one cannot be first in everything .
this is a chamber that was 1 / 400th the size of Biosphere 2 that we called our Test Module .
have you ever been to Britain ?
they go , &quot; But how can I possibly find my way in that ?
AK : yeah , it &apos;s basically a dead object , as you can see , and it only lives because you make it .
and I feel that here .
the idea is that basically -- if it &apos;s constantly like &quot; Huh ? ... Huh ? &quot;
it never left my brain .
B.P. operated very sloppily and very recklessly because they could .
what can you tell me about Tom ?
have you ever helped your wife in cooking ?
as I was having lunch , the phone rang .
they &apos;re going to be entering this car one by one .
I had my purse stolen in the bus .
and it went from about 25 million dollars to 150 million dollars .
in fact , those entire communities really don &apos;t have many options .
he didn &apos;t eat anything yesterday .
Tom , I really like you ... as a friend .
an African economy can be broken up into three sectors .
have they put up the wrong slide ? &quot;
that &apos;s inconceivable , of course .
she took the punishment with a smile .
then I just pick things up .
he is by far the best student .
if the monster wants you , the monster &apos;s gonna get you .
we &apos;re still in Boston .
is this typewriter yours ?
change is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in software .
mostly the issues there are legal issues and breaking copy protections .
the bomb attacks forever destroyed countless historic buildings which had stood for centuries .
no , no .
in addition , wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza .
I was just trying to help .
and most of all , a kind of normalized political fear invaded our lives .
do you have a pencil about you ?
unfortunately , Tom wasn &apos;t there .
Tom is well off now .
Boil one egg .
there goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding .
the ring was nowhere to be found .
each one has got two games .
very interesting . the car industry has been focused just on themselves .
it would be better if you didn &apos;t eat before going to bed .
Tom ate something .
it has wonderful properties .
get away from here !
is that Mars Ya Marov ?
or , when he &apos;s more relaxed , the head comes down and the ears listen , either side .
now some of this is a difference of opinion , and that &apos;s not my main complaint .
and it does actually seem to be trying to eat the electronic jellyfish .
so , 10,000 households or bust .
aging , disease , health , medicine , science
he is at home today .
Peres thought that was a great idea .
I called our London office . they said that Tom left for Boston yesterday .
are you having more trouble dialing the phone than you used to ?
your hair is too long .
behavioral markers matter .
entertainment , live music , music , performance
could you please say that once again in French ?
for the next 14 minutes or whatever it is , will you feel stuff ?
my father is proud of me being tall and handsome .
the vaccine effort though is really quite different .
and one of them is called Taketa . which is which ?
I &apos;m not sure what Tom is trying to say .
I never had the courage to open it .
that &apos;s easy to say , but it &apos;s not easy to do .
I don &apos;t care for sports .
going way out , dark matter conforms to the same mycelial archetype .
this is the same village in Cambodia , just a couple of months ago .
what &apos;s the next station ?
it is a step in the right direction .
what do you do when you have this sort of disrupted flow ?
alright . let &apos;s leave that .
that &apos;s interesting to me .
Tom is going to be very hurt .
the result now follows from proposition 1.3 .
now , there was an interesting thing that happened last April .
did you see what I did ?
and of course , bees are not the only important factor here .
and this region , it &apos;s a very small region -- it &apos;s less than one millimeter .
like everybody else , I was entranced yesterday by the animal session .
her eyes were shining with joy .
he was shivering from the cold .
that &apos;s the question that sort of hit me in the middle of a Davos afternoon about four years ago .
I already said no .
I get a breath of tear gas and I can &apos;t breathe .
they &apos;re a sort of ectosymbiont .
she &apos;s combing her hair .
art , arts , creativity , design , poetry , software , technology
I mean , what is a biosphere ?
you are not at all what I expected .
I could spend hours in here .
so you should have as an answer either a six @-@ digit or probably a seven @-@ digit number .
I hid from Tom behind the garage .
do you have any film for this camera ?
I &apos;ve moved the microphone 20 centimeters .
in June , the World Health Organization declared the first global flu pandemic in 41 years .
this is a picture of a central African hunter .
health is all I want .
the ears are obviously a very important emotional indicator of the horse .
we &apos;ve got to tell Tom .
Tom is a prisoner .
can you open this for me ?
all this makes up a constructive and ascending social dynamic .
I was here to see the launch of this particular type of instrument .
Tom played with his kids .
he would give an arm and a leg for that .
but -- when he began to speak they would actually recognize his voice from the radio .
I think that &apos;s the most important thing that people have , is compassion .
it has zero volume . and it &apos;s non @-@ orientable .
this means , certainly , to retrain all health staff .
and secondly , it &apos;s trying to remind you of what there is to fear and to hate .
the book is on course reserve .
Tom probably wants to eat some Chinese food .
every time I practice shooting , I miss the target .
please don &apos;t ask Tom .
and I want to just make one point about this investment .
we stop for a drink of water .
and that &apos;s me right there in a brown coat .
Tom was an artist .
and he felt that -- he felt that it was coming to ask for help . sorry .
unfortunately I hardly speak any German .
but what we call it is R &amp; D @-@ I @-@ Y , or research and develop it yourself .
so you really see how this kind of crowd @-@ sourced imagery is integrating , in a very deep way , into the map itself .
as have this guy &apos;s .
stop being pessimistic ! everything will sort itself out .
Tom spent thirty years in prison .
the proportion of the world &apos;s population speaking English as a first language is declining , and will continue to do so .
it was very difficult to convince Tom .
the adults can recognize the juveniles ; the juveniles can recognize the adults .
you &apos;re on your own .
she has been dead for ten years .
anybody is better than nobody .
I &apos;ll be back home toward the end of the month .
Tom promised he &apos;d go straight home .
AB : seven ? seven ?
I &apos;ll ask you these questions .
they are brothers .
I can speak English .
doesn &apos;t that prove something ?
Tom almost died in that accident .
and the U.K. had 100 years of economic growth .
I used to keep a diary when I was at high school .
some of them were dolphin liver . some of them were dolphin blubber .
Ken mistook you for me .
and so he starts working every morning at four o &apos;clock in the morning .
people like me , on the other hand , rock the boat .
it raises a red flag for businessmen .
he lives with his mom .
she cackled at the poor man . &quot; so it is that you have one wish left . &quot;
could you give us a minute ?
this is better than the performance of many OECD countries .
a retired school teacher , there she is with a Social Security administrator .
how long have you been in love with her ?
and the first thing you &apos;re going to see is a transect screen that is about a meter across .
Tom is always very aggressive .
Google enriches itself by enriching thousands of bloggers through AdSense .
also , he hopes for social and economic improvements for his own family .
I had planned to stop at the supermarket on the way home , but it was closed .
if she did not kill him , then who did ?
there must be some misunderstanding .
we didn &apos;t say we &apos;re going to send a man 20 percent to the moon .
my lunch break &apos;s almost over .
I have to go to the doctor .
I had been growing all my own food .
and that &apos;s essentially what we &apos;re trying to build .
we have opportunities in agriculture , like I said .
and that constant is the speed of sound .
is there a big market for this kind of thing these days ?
she &apos;s the only one who doesn &apos;t know .
I am blinking my eyes .
this is freaky is a major way .
he watched the Swedish film .
this is the story of a rake in my backyard .
have you already made friends with her ?
you &apos;ve seen what Tom can do .
can you prove the validity of your assertion ?
our artists are at risk .
Tom slept on the couch .
he paid the money back .
do you actually want it online ?
and as long as you teach them that , you can teach them anything else you like .
I wish that sentence weren &apos;t in there , because I think it is false .
Spellchecking will usually catch most of your typos .
I &apos;ve decided that , for me at least , I don &apos;t have a big enough head .
audience : 1949 . AB : 1949 , and the month ?
I &apos;ve got some questions for you .
http : / / www.ted.com / talks / nathan _ wolfe _ hunts _ for _ the _ next _ aids.html
Tom doesn &apos;t know how deep the pool is .
thank you .
Tom appeared calm .
thank you so much for sharing .
there &apos;s a lot you can &apos;t see , also , underwater .
this is at 3,000 feet in Monterey Canyon .
it &apos;s in its early stages , but this is what it looks like right now .
then , one night , the scene changes .
carl Safina : the oil spill &apos;s unseen culprits , victims
Tom has a lot of friends in Boston .
our teacher is going to the USA next month .
why don &apos;t you sit down and relax ?
I am following that car .
don &apos;t you have any shame at all ?
it can make a mountain go from this to this in a few short months .
don &apos;t you have to go to school today ?
he ran toward me as fast as he could .
my father was a professor .
you &apos;ll never guess what happened to me today .
education is the best antidote against violence .
Tom and Mary took a selfie together .
an American Government cannot permit Americans to starve .
I just bought another sweater . now I have 21 !
Tom seems unsure .
so the year I turned eight we got a new house boy .
are you ready ? okay .
we finally found the key .
I &apos;d like to be your friend .
do you know what day it is today ?
thanks for staying with me .
they &apos;re multiplying like rabbits .
this is the Oryx .
it &apos;s not something you want to put on your Facebook page , right ?
Tom knew that Mary wanted John to ask Alice to do that .
I am a Berliner .
here comes Euler .
let us briefly recall an important result from group theory .
but it got me thinking , what would my caregivers do with me ?
the proposed method is applied to three simulated case studies .
and Ghosn came up and said , &quot; I have the car , Mr. Peres ; I will build you the cars . &quot;
it &apos;s sort of like ding , ding , ding .
most people around here have no electricity .
I bought an umbrella .
so this leads me to think of this in a different way .
Tom thought about this .
which is right : Iraq or Iran ?
is he endorsing creationism here ? &quot;
my aunt dropped in on me yesterday .
what is Tom &apos;s shoe size ?
stacey Kramer : the best gift I ever survived
so , until then , basically people were living on top of their trades .
so some of them actually seem to have powers like superheroes in a comic book .
and he was waving a piece of paper , and he was yelling , &quot; Call Washington ! call Washington ! &quot;
so I urge you to take that path .
I won &apos;t even write these down -- I &apos;ll just call them out as they &apos;re called out to me .
the men are going fishing in these small boats .
Kermit the Frog means nothing to me . &quot;
he is doing a super job .
Tom does that , but Mary doesn &apos;t .
Google , business , economics , entertainment , global issues , media , news , short talk
but we think this virus is pretty ubiquitous .
Tom was in his office all morning .
so the camera &apos;s black and white .
Tom &apos;s palms were sweaty and his mouth was dry .
we &apos;re going to be doing genuine physics . &quot;
who removed it ?
it &apos;s got a light organ under its eye .
and the problem is we can &apos;t afford it today , folks .
you should carry out your duty .
that &apos;s a cool name . I will say that .
I told you Tom wouldn &apos;t want to go .
the small seed became a large tree .
who &apos;s your aunt ?
so , players were often seriously injured and sometimes even killed in these rough games .
once again , the Cartesian kind of cross @-@ over .
well the Russians have a tank in their own backyard .
and they had some , in my opinion , terrible Christmas music .
I know Tom is old .
they are also able to play -- they are really playing .
both black holes are getting closer together .
one cup of tea became several .
here &apos;s the world based on the way it looks -- based on landmass .
Tom works harder than he used to .
so is that wrong ?
this is again , indicating how numbers relate to space relate to form , maps of the universe .
and I want to start by telling you a story about that change in Africa .
danny Hillis : the Internet could crash . we need a Plan B
in fact , all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating .
there is a bridge across the river .
I work in old @-@ age homes , largely .
Mary works in a supermarket .
and what if she rejects me ?
they &apos;re absolutely inspirational for me .
Tycho Brahe benefited greatly from King Fredrik &apos;s generous support .
would you be kind enough to put in a word for me ?
some of you , I &apos;m sure , will be familiar with this .
why doesn &apos;t he tell me jokes anymore ?
hurry up ! we are drowning !
we see light reflected off the Moon .
that guy is totally nuts !
he was a college professor at a state school ; he knows what paperwork looks like .
so what we added is a second element to our network , which is a battery swap system .
I wish we had time .
as have this guy &apos;s .
put your toys away .
but helping Africa has been turned into a theater of the absurd .
I strolled along the streets to kill time .
and there &apos;s no time to do it .
where is your money ?
the house needs a new coat of paint .
there &apos;s what we call atavism activation .
let &apos;s ask if it &apos;s true .
are you a student ?
this is an optical lure that I &apos;ve used .
everything that Tom said is true .
I walked into the Carnegie asking for a grant .
he didn &apos;t have as much trouble finding a job as he thought he would .
my family loved Tom .
I don &apos;t want you to ring me up all the time .
Tom looks unconvinced .
I &apos;m sure you meant well .
then this occasional compassion , we are not talking about -- it will never remain occasional .
Tom &apos;s house is completely destroyed .
Tom was born into a poor family .
&quot; is it the first time you &apos;ve been here ? &quot; &quot; Yes , it &apos;s my first visit . &quot;
Tom almost never complains about anything .
it transcends nation , the gender , the age .
corruption alone costs Africa 148 billion dollars a year .
it was a very good experience for him .
does he come here ?
my journey as an artist started from a very , very personal place .
that will not succeed .
AK : Joey , Joey , Joey , Joey .
that &apos;s really important .
and so he agreed .
the connection with the machine is much more easy , much more even ethically possible .
I found this observation test about the story of the ark .
it only started with the birth of modern bureaucracy , and of industrial revolution .
why doesn &apos;t Tom have to pay anything ?
this is better than the performance of many OECD countries .
she likes miniskirts .
the boss said this group is a real mixed bag . I wonder if he places me with the wheat or the chaff .
Tom leaned back .
did you and Tom discuss a price ?
are tickets for the concert available here ?
every top adds up to 37 .
OK , notice there &apos;s now a roof above us .
we &apos;re also going back over microfilm and getting that online .
and there will be about a 20 percent chance we &apos;ll recover him .
I &apos;ve forgotten to pose your question to Tom and Mary .
&quot; my 12 year @-@ old son has autism and has had a terrible time with math .
I don &apos;t think I snore .
I &apos;ll give you a few quotes .
and one morning , I was riding the subway .
do you know this ?
so this was in the winter of 2009 -- 8 : 30 in the morning .
once again , Nicaragua let me down .
audience : 23 .
mind your language .
five minutes I &apos;ll spend just because it &apos;s interesting . just because it &apos;s fun .
I do a lot of worrying .
Tom only sleeps about five hours a night .
it took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem .
he acknowledged it to be true .
I &apos;ve done that a few times .
so eight of us went in : four men and four women .
what have I missed ?
Tom scrubbed his feet .
and if so , how did they make arrangements ?
now where is the car industry on that ?
no , you may not put the colander on your head ; you can be an astronaut after I drain the pasta .
don &apos;t set foot in that neighborhood .
I blanched .
but what Galileo saw was a rocky , barren world , which he expressed through his watercolor painting .
Mary lacks common sense .
Tom asked me if I wasn &apos;t feeling well .
it was astonishing . they were also producing mangroves in a plantation .
and I think this is actually a shrimp that &apos;s releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water .
let &apos;s see .
astronomy , comedy , humor , map , science
you cannot be too careful driving a car .
the password is &quot; Muiriel . &quot;
I think I &apos;ll try to do that this weekend . thank you . &quot;
and by tiny , I mean really .
and we need help . of course , we need help .
and it was like playing atomic hide @-@ and @-@ seek .
how about a two @-@ digit number ?
this was one of the groups .
look at Africa &apos;s begging @-@ bowl .
they said culture .
I know what Tom did to you .
talk of the devil and he &apos;s sure to appear .
I think that &apos;s a lot of hogwash .
there is no verb for compassion , but you have an adverb for compassion .
all humans are good at heart .
the full videos are online if you are interested .
I know you &apos;ve been through a lot .
and we were able to grow cherry tomatoes and cucumbers , all kinds of stuff .
peace , health , serenity , happiness , nirvana .
SK : yeah , it &apos;s ready .
our nation is very fond of baseball .
that blip , that information , shot into you before that .
I always enjoy listening to classical music in my free time .
you have the crude oil .
she &apos;s here today with us in the audience .
I don &apos;t like getting up so early in the morning .
how many oceans are there ?
and we did . we got better material .
again , I fear it will cost money .
what is a calendar ?
but instead , I go out and I find things .
does that mean something ?
Tom is going to love living here .
everyone was satisfied .
Tom told me that he won &apos;t tell Mary what happened .
it &apos;s basically a matter of deciding to do it .
so the recovery rate of all this stuff is going to be variable .
if you want to learn a language , you need a reason to stay motivated .
prices have been rising since last year .
so , look , if we could have this screen live ...
Tom is honorable .
everybody has their favorite drink .
these flowers are for Mary , not for you .
she often eats breakfast there .
here comes Euler .
Tom is irresistible .
it was extraordinary .
it &apos;s very important to respect the rules .
that &apos;s my job , not Tom &apos;s .
the architecture in this part of the city is ugly .
and when people tell me , &quot; Who &apos;s going to teach the teachers to teach the kids ? &quot;
she was in a hurry .
and if dinner isn &apos;t entirely obvious , think of sex .
everything happened too fast .
for instance , here they are laying down the balloon fabric behind , which is eventually going to be filled up with helium .
we &apos;re confident that you are up to the challenge of the new position .
we need water .
I don &apos;t want to sell my soul for money .
he &apos;s got no body , no man , just a head floating high .
I play the piano a little .
I haven &apos;t apologized to Tom yet .
in the economic system in traditional Africa , the means of production is privately owned .
I couldn &apos;t have said that better myself .
hello ? and I can ... hello ... okay .
but it has to be safe exploration .
and now we come to my problem .
this is the first general hospital in Vienna .
but when you got to the ocean , my imagination was no competition for nature .
it &apos;s not an only @-@ in @-@ school thing .
in the years to come thy memory will shine like a star over my lonely life .
the mushrooms then are harvested , but very importantly , the mycelium has converted the cellulose into fungal sugars .
this doesn &apos;t make any sense .
Tom is probably going to be able to answer your question .
how to tell a political story but an allegorical story .
audience : Yes .
so , starting with your seven @-@ digit number , call out any six of them please .
and all of a sudden , this plastic bag was extremely beautiful to me .
we speak French at home .
it &apos;s white noise ; it &apos;s such a chaotic ringing .
Tom was out of town when the fire broke out .
can you tell me how ?
the boy feared the dark .
but today both countries say the best defense is to attack .
audience : 37 .
do you really think money will bring you happiness ?
put your money where you mouth is . &quot;
I saw five planes taking off , as if they were birds .
we heard Tom come downstairs .
now within our community , a certain culture has appeared .
OK , so this is a picture , and I &apos;m going to show you some pictures now from the field .
&quot; no , &quot; the shopkeeper replied . &quot; I &apos;m quite serious . you saw the price tag . &quot;
did the police arrest Tom ?
can I see it ?
I should &apos;ve just given Tom what he wanted .
Tom was trying to kill Mary .
why are you crying ?
I hope that that after this talk you &apos;ll be doing that .
so , without any more stalling , here we go .
Tom said it wasn &apos;t necessary .
we then were sort of coined as the guys who run only in small islands .
you &apos;re going to have to pay in advance .
not stamps , but one day .
Darwin said , &quot; I have never been an atheist in the same sense of denying the existence of a God .
Mr. White seems to have many friends .
there &apos;s still a long way to go , but that there &apos;s a will there .

Moleeds are what I believe the thing that will allow string theory to be proved .
now , so I know the frequency .
mosquitoes in Minnesota are as big as storks .
BG : and the collaboration you &apos;re doing with Los Altos , how did that come about ?
find yourselves a seat .
we can integrate over the surface , and the notation usually is a capital sigma .
must have been a very interesting day in the Shoemaker house .
the enzymes remanufactured the hydrocarbons into carbohydrates -- fungal sugars .
they are stuck in their intellectual patch .
Tom isn &apos;t as tall as his father yet .
so here are some half @-@ finished horses ready to be worked in London .
thanks for listening .
so far we have been quite successful .
he goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish .
in a mangrove forest like this I have no idea .
and you see things like this .
Tom asked Mary for a divorce .
evolution , humanity , personal growth , science , self
Ubald laughs at me when I show this photo because of course you can &apos;t see his face .
Mary doesn &apos;t like parsley .
seth Berkley : really cool video , isn &apos;t it ?
they had the work finished .
Tom is going to do that again .
I &apos;m trying to do this in English .
you &apos;ll have a new understanding and trust in your body .
you must learn to see life as it is .
thank you .
it &apos;s phenomenal .
Tom has to do this .
Tom looked guilty .
it &apos;s got a lot of other light organs you can &apos;t see , but you &apos;ll see in here in a minute .
Yerevan is the capital of Armenia .
and when I hear music that I don &apos;t like , I try to make it better .
the university graduated 500 students last year .
about 10 percent of the hearing impaired people get musical hallucinations .
it &apos;s a true story -- every bit of this is true .
become a catalyst of change . teach others ; learn about it ; talk about it .
so it &apos;s a continued fight .
they seem to come from the outside , and to mimic perception .
I studied for a year in Boston .
the original thought I had : this must be ethanol .
how come you &apos;re so crazy ?
what would our sleeping patterns be in the sort of ideal sense ?
this statue belongs to us .
Tom hasn &apos;t accomplished anything yet .
if you go to the Gulf and you look around , you do see a lot of oil .
I purchased one .
Mary told Tom that she thought John was impolite .
maybe the swami is right .
... &quot; currently listening to Evan Williams . &quot;
Tom sat on the floor surrounded by a bunch of children .
Tom and Mary walked out of the classroom .
why isn &apos;t Tom doing that ?
what difference did that make ?
so I got a lot of reader feedback on that one .
what impression do you have of China ?
I don &apos;t have any other option .
Tom invited Mary over to his place for dinner .
AB : Yes ? Oh , one more , one more three @-@ digit number please .
it &apos;s an accurate representation , and it &apos;s pretty much at the correct speed for what is occurring inside you .
I just did that this morning .
Mrs. Blewett darted her eyes over Anne from head to foot .
I can teach you how to dance .
you cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water .
the temperature &apos;s fallen below zero .
Tom had forgotten his umbrella so I lent him one of mine .

it inhales oxygen , just like we do .
and he transformed our understanding of the Moon .
compassion is not defined in one form .
sweet dreams !
so the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light .
I &apos;m not a patient person .
if you want to change the world , you have to group together , you have to be collaborative .
it so happens that these weapons are dangerous .
better beautiful and rich than ugly and poor .
some restrictions may apply .
activism , bottom @-@ up , community , global issues , philanthropy , potential
Tom couldn &apos;t have done what you say he did .
how many people are you expecting ?
this is Sierra Leone .
and then everyone started laughing .
my grandmother has got old .
I could make you happy .
this is a very reactive , crisis @-@ driven system .
what &apos;s it going to take to persuade you ?
and it has since moved to her bones and her brain .
superstition is the religion of feeble minds .
so privatization is one of the things we &apos;ve done .
call Tom and tell him to come here .
they chat to each other every day , a few times a day actually .
Tom banged his knee .
Tom lives in a Hispanic neighborhood .
and if they do mention them to their own doctors they may be misdiagnosed .
I want to start with these word pairs here .
CA : actually , let me just ask a question .
&quot; jump across the ditch . &quot; &quot; I will if you will . &quot;
this is the most absurd thing I have ever heard .
it &apos;s a quite wonderfully designed animal .
this person is a teacher .
we cannot gainsay that he is honest .
do you want to go out tonight ?
there could be non @-@ linearities , threshold effects .
that can wait until later .
where is my pen ?
can I try this on ?
Tom fell asleep right away .
she was my first love .
each year , twenty @-@ seven million acres of the tropical rainforests are destroyed .
I have no one to turn to for advice .

what &apos;s going on in the street in Mumbai ?
I should have paid my rent yesterday .

before winter I &apos;ll have the windows painted , as the paint on them is slowly peeling off , especially outside .

give Tom his keys .
I wonder what happened to ancient Rome .

regarding cyberattacks against the American company Google .
&apos;Poor boy ! &apos; said the old poet again , taking him by the hand , and leading him into his room . &apos; come to me , and we &apos;ll soon make thee warm again , and I will give thee some wine , and some roasted apples for thy supper , my pretty child ! &apos;

Tom told me to be there by 2 : 30 .

the cop &apos;s chasing me .
I &apos;m outraged !

is it because his name is really Jupiter Blunck ?
Tom is still overweight .
but literally the next day they were like , &quot; Can you start in two weeks ? &quot;
